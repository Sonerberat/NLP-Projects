1. In prepare_dataset.py, I pre-process the voice dataset extracting MFCCs (https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/lau...) and saving them in a JSON file\
2. In train.py, train a simple speech recognition system using TensorFlow and Keras.
3. In keyword_spotting_service.py, making predictions with the speech recognition system which is previously implemented in TensorFlow (Train.py)
